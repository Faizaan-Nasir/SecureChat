# SecureChat ðŸ’¬
## About
This is a python based application made with the purpose to create a somewhat secure chatting platform with end to end service. This application is made by 
a 12th Grader with PyQt5 and MySQL Connector Python modules. The use of this application is pretty straight forward.
